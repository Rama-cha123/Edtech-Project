Overview

Project Title:
  House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

Objective:
  To develop a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other related factors. The aim is to provide accurate price     predictions, which can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

Key Activities:
Data Collection and Preparation:

  Gathering historical housing data from publicly available sources.
  Cleaning and preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing data patterns and trends.
  Identifying key factors influencing house prices.
Model Development:

  Implementing a linear regression model to establish relationships between features and house prices.
  Splitting data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
Model Evaluation and Optimization:

  Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
  Optimizing the model for better predictions.
Visualization and Reporting:

  Presenting findings and results through visualizations and a detailed project report.
Technologies Used:
  Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Tools:
  Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
  Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
  Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
  Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook/VS Code
